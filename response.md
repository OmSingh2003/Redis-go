Yes, the original issues have been solved, and the agent is fixing a new issue that was discovered in the process!

Current status:

1. âœ… Fixed the Go module setup in go.mod:
   - Updated Go version from non-existent 1.24.2 to valid 1.21
   - Properly formatted the dependencies
   - Successfully ran `go mod tidy` to download dependencies

2. âœ… Fixed the import path in main.go:
   - Successfully updated from "redis-go/proto" to "goredis/proto"
   - Used the sed command to make the change

3. ðŸ”„ Working on a new issue discovered after fixing the original problems:
   - Found that the code uses the "strings" package but doesn't import it
   - The agent tried to add it with sed but it created a syntax error
   - Now fixing the entire import section to properly include all packages

The original issues that you asked about have been fixed, and the agent is now addressing this additional syntax issue to get your code fully compiling.

Yes, part of the issue has been solved, but there's still more work in progress:

1. âœ… The Go module setup has been fixed by:
   - Updating go.mod to use a valid Go version (1.21)
   - Properly formatting the dependencies
   - Successfully running `go mod tidy`

2. ðŸ”„ Currently, the terminal AI agent is working on fixing the import path issue:
   - Your main.go file is trying to import "redis-go/proto"
   - But your module name is "goredis" (as specified in go.mod)
   - The agent is changing the import to "goredis/proto" to match your module name

The compilation error should be resolved once the import path is fixed. The agent has identified the correct solution and is implementing it now.

Based on the terminal history, I can see that your Go module had issues with the go.mod file. The file contained:

1. An invalid Go version (1.24.2)
2. Improperly formatted dependencies
3. A missing version for the github.com/OmSingh2003/Redis-go dependency

The terminal AI agent identified these issues and was working on fixing them, but I don't see confirmation in the history that the fix was completed successfully.

To properly initialize your Go module, you should:

1. Use a valid Go version (like 1.21)
2. Format dependencies correctly
3. Add proper versions for all dependencies

You could try running these commands to fix it:

```bash
# Update the go.mod file with correct content
cat > go.mod << EOL
module goredis

go 1.21
require github.com/tidwall/resp v0.1.1
EOL

# Then download dependencies
go mod tidy
```

This should properly set up your Go module with the tidwall/resp dependency.
